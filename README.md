Project Descriptions:

Create a web application where user can drop a text file. The text file contains geolocation information (latitudes and longitudes set/list)(ex: 43.65748683, -79.37976122).
- Get user current position and display on a map in the same page: may use any map api for this purpose.
- Using web worker calculate the distance, in kilometer, between the current location (cannot be hardcoded, geolocation api) and coordinate inside the text file with the ‘haversine formula’.
- Provide an interface for user to set Current any location for comparison.
- Reverse geocoding: get human readable information such as name of street, city and country for each set of latitude and long.
- Programmatically display, with good styling, the information in a on your page inside a previously empty <section>.
- All lab requirements are to be done within one page that is viewable on any platform via a modern browser.
